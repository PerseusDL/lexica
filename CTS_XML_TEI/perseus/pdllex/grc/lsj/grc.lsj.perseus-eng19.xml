            <p TEIform="p">More than eighty years have passed since the first edition of the famous Lexicon
upon which the present work is based was published by the Clarendon Press. Henry
George Liddell and Robert Scott—the latter a Craven and Ireland Scholar—were both
placed in the First Class in the Oxford list of 1833, both having been born in 1811. In
1835 Scott became a Fellow of Balliol and in the following year Liddell was elected to
a Studentship of Christ Church. It appears that Mr. Talboys, an Oxford bookseller and
publisher, first approached Scott with a proposal that a Greek-English Lexicon, based
on that of Franz Passow, should be compiled, and that Scott made his acceptance conditional
on the consent of Liddell to join in the work; at any rate, it was Talboys who first
undertook the publication, which was taken over after his retirement by the Clarendon
Press. There is, however, some ground for thinking that William Sewell, who had been
an examiner in the Schools of 1833, suggested the idea to Liddell and Scott; and Liddell
mentions in his correspondence the encouragement which the project received from
Dean Gaisford.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">The Lexicon of Passow, which the Oxford scholars took as the basis of their work,
was itself founded upon that of Johann Gottlob Schneider, the editor of Theophrastus, the
first edition of which had appeared in 1797-8. Passow had laid down, in his Essay on
<title TEIform="title">Zweck, Anlage, und Ergänzung griechischer Wörterbücher</title>, published in 1812, the canons
by which the lexicographer should be guided, amongst which the most important was the
requirement that citations should be chronologically arranged in order to exhibit the
history of each word and its uses. In obedience to this principle, Passow based his work
on a special study of the Early Epic vocabulary, and the relatively full treatment of
Homeric usage is a legacy bequeathed by him to Liddell and Scott which has persisted
throughout the successive editions of their work.   The first edition of his Lexicon
appeared in 1819, and his expressed intention was to expand the work gradually by
incorporating successively the results of special studies of Early Lyric Poetry, the Ionic
Prose of Herodotus and Hippocrates, the Attic dramatists, and the Attic Prose writers:
but little change was made in his second and third editions (1825 and 1827), and the fourth
(1831), in which the Early Lyric poets and Herodotus received fuller recognition, was
the first in which he felt himself at liberty to omit the name of Schneider from his
title-page and also the last to appear in his lifetime. He died in 1833 in his forty-seventh
year.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">In the meantime two attempts had been made to adapt the <title TEIform="title">Thesaurus Linguae Graecae</title>
of Henri Estienne to modern uses. The first of these was the result of the activities of
Abraham Valpy, and was largely the work of E. H. Barker of Trinity College, Cambridge.
It was completed in nine folio volumes, published in 1819-28, and reproduced the text
of Stephanus' <title TEIform="title">Thesaurus</title>, interlarded with a mass of copious but ill-digested information.
The first volume met with vigorous and not undeserved criticism on the part of Bishop
Blomfield in an article in the <title TEIform="title">Quarterly Review (vol</title>. xxii, pp. 302 ff.) which is marred by
a lavish display of <foreign lang="la" TEIform="foreign">odium philologicum</foreign>. The editors, however, profited by the Bishop's
strictures, and his prophecy that a work in which 139 columns were devoted to the word


<pb n="iv" TEIform="pb"/>

               <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">a)/galma</foreign> would run to fifty volumes and attain to completion in 1889 was signally falsified.
The work labours under the serious disadvantage of retaining the etymological arrangement
of Stephanus,<note n="1" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">In 1812 Passow himself had advocated the retention of Stephanus' arrangement; but he fortunately
 abandoned it in favour of the alphabetical principle.</note> which forces the reader to make a laborious search for any compound
or derived word.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">This mistake was avoided by the compilers of the Paris <title TEIform="title">Thesaurus</title>, the publication
 of which was begun in 1831 by Firmin-Didot, and was placed under the general editorship
 of Karl Benedict Hase. This enterprise was also subjected to criticism in the <title TEIform="title">Quarterly
 Review</title> (vol. li, pp. 144 ff.) by J. R. Fishlake (the translator of Buttmann's <title TEIform="title">Lexilogus</title>) on the
 ground of its unwieldy bulk; but the association of the brothers Wilhelm and Ludwig
 Dindorf at an early stage of the work<note n="2" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">Their names appeared on the title-page of Part IV (containing <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">b</foreign>), which appeared concurrently
with the second half of <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">a</foreign>.</note> enabled it to be carried through in thirty-four years,
 and its vast collections of material, though often ill-arranged and unevenly treated, were
 largely drawn upon by Liddell and Scott in their successive editions.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">The first of these appeared in 1843; it was a quarto volume of 1,583 pages, priced at
 42s., and 6,000 copies were printed. A second, revised and enlarged, was called for in 1845,
 and the editors acknowledged their indebtedness to the German lexicon of Wilhelm Pape,
 which had appeared almost simultaneously with their own.   In 1849 a third edition,
 corrected, but not substantially enlarged, was published, and six years later came the
 fourth, revised throughout. This marks a considerable advance on its predecessors, and
 much additional material was inserted; but the writers specially recognized were still
 chiefly those of the early classical period, including the Lyric poets, the authors of the
 Hippocratean writings, and the Attic orators. The editors now felt justified in omitting the
 name of Passow from their title-page. Eight thousand copies of this edition were printed,
 and the price was reduced to <measure type="currency" TEIform="measure">30s</measure>. After another interval of six years the fifth edition,
 'revised and augmented', appeared in 1861, and use was made of the greatly enlarged fifth
 edition of Passow, published by Valentin Rost and Friedrich Palm and completed in 1857,
 while the philological information was recast in the light of G. Curtius' <title TEIform="title">Griechische Etymologie</title>
 (1858). There were 10,000 copies of this edition, priced at <measure type="currency" TEIform="measure">31s. 6d</measure>. The sixth is dated in
 1869; it was again considerably augmented, the number of pages being increased from 1,644
 to 1,865, and the verbal forms were more fully given with the aid of Veitch's <title TEIform="title">Greek Verbs,
 irregular and defective</title> (2nd ed., 1866). Of this edition 15,00000 copies were printed, and the
 price was raised to <measure type="currency" TEIform="measure">36s</measure>. Fourteen years later appeared a seventh edition, revised by
 Liddell, whose Preface is dated October 1882; the page was enlarged, and this made
 a reduction in the number to 1,776 possible. Bonitz's Index to Aristotle (1870) and Roehl's
 Index to <title TEIform="title">CIG</title> (1877) were largely drawn upon, and help was received from American
 scholars-Professors Drisler, Goodwin, and Gildersleeve-especially in regard to the
 particles and the technical terms of Attic law. This edition was stereotyped, and from
 time to time reprinted. Finally, in 1897, there was published an eighth edition, in which
 such corrections were made as could be inserted without altering the pagination. This
 made it impossible to take full account of such new sources as the <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">*)aqhnai/wb *politei/a</foreign>, but
 there was a short list of Addenda, containing references to this work and to inscriptions
 published in the <title TEIform="title">Journal of Hellenic Studies</title>. Liddell appears to have been engaged for
 some years after the publication of the seventh edition on a lexicographical study of inscriptions;
Sir William Thiselton-Dyer has kindly placed at my disposal two volumes of
 an interleaved edition of the abridged Lexicon in which his collections of material, largely
 drawn from the <title TEIform="title">Corpus Inscriptionum Atticarum</title> and Roehl's <title TEIform="title">Inscriptiones Graecae Antiquissimae</title>,
are contained; but he seems to have laid the work aside in his later years,
 and he died in 1898, at the age of 87, a few months after the appearance of the eighth edition.

<pb n="v" TEIform="pb"/>
            </p>
            <p TEIform="p">Some five years later the Delegates of the Clarendon Press were invited to consider
the revision of the Lexicon with a view to the incorporation of the rapidly growing material
supplied by newly discovered texts on stone and papyrus, for which room might be found
by the adoption of more compendious methods of reference; and a conference took place
in March 1903, for which Ingram Bywater prepared a memorandum on the projected
revision, advice being sought from Henry Jackson, Sir Richard Jebb, J. E. B. Mayor, and
Arthur Sidgwick. The Delegates received the project favourably and it was hoped that
Mr. Sidgwick might be able to act as editor. Contributions were invited in his name and
a fair amount of material was collected, including a large number of notes and suggestions
by Professor Leeper of Melbourne. Amongst other English and American scholars
whose contributions were of considerable extent may be named the Rev. M. A. Bayfield
and Prof. C. J. Goodwin, and particularly Mr. Herbert W. Greene, of whose services
to the Lexicon more will be said presently. Mr. Sidgwick was, however, prevented by
his duties as a teacher and afterwards by the failure of his health from commencing
the work of revision.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">In the meantime two more ambitious schemes had been initiated. At the second
general assembly of the International Association of Academies, held in London in May
1904, Sir Richard Jebb submitted on behalf of the British Academy a scheme for the
compilation of a new Thesaurus of Ancient Greek up to the early part of the seventh
century A.D.; and after a discussion in which the difficulty and magnitude of the
enterprise were emphasized<note n="1" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">Krumbacher was anxious to include Byzantine Greek in the ambit of the new Thesaurus.</note> a Committee of Inquiry, consisting of Sir R. C. Jebb, Professors
Diels, Gomperz, Heiberg, Krumbacher, Leo, and M. Perrot, with power to co-opt,
was appointed to consider method, means, and preliminary questions in connexion with
the proposal. In 1905 Prof. P. Kretschmer was added to the Committee, which drafted
a memorandum on the question of establishing a periodical '<title TEIform="title">Archiv</title>' and an office for
the collection of slips. At the close of the year Jebb, who had acted as Chairman, died,
and was replaced in 1906 by Gomperz, while Bywater was added to the Committee,
which, at a meeting held at Vienna in May, decided to constitute itself a permanent and
independent body.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">The difficulties of the project had been incisively stated by Diels in an article
published in the <title TEIform="title">Neue Jahrbücher</title> for 1905,<note n="2" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">p. 692; Diels had already expressed his views in his <title TEIform="title">Elementum</title> (1899), p. ix sqq.</note> in the course of which he wrote as follows:

<quote TEIform="quote">
                  <p TEIform="p">Any one who bears in mind the bulk of Greek literature, which is at least 10 times as great
       [as that of Latin], its dialectical variations, its incredible wealth of forms, the obstinate persistence of
       the classical speech for thousands of years down to the fall of Constantinople, or, if you will, until
       the present day: who knows, moreover, that the editions of almost all the Greek classics are entirely
       unsuited for the purposes of slipping, that for many important writers no critical editions whatever exist:
       and who considers the state of our collections of fragments and special Lexica, will see that at the
       present time all the bases upon which a Greek Thesaurus could be erected are lacking.
       
       </p>
                  <p TEIform="p">But even if we were to assume that we possessed such editions and collections from Homer down
       to Nonnus, or (as Krumbacher proposed in London) down to Apostolius, and further that they had all
       been worked over, slipped, or excerpted by a gigantic staff of scholars, and that a great house had
       preserved and stored the thousands of boxes, whence would come the time, money, and power to sift
       these millions of slips and to bring <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">*nou=s</foreign> into this Chaos ? Since the proportion of Latin to Greek
       Literature is about 1:10, the office work of the Greek Thesaurus would occupy at least 100 scholars.
       At their head there would have to be a general editor, who, however, would be more of a general than an
       editor. And if this editorial cohort were really to perform its task punctually, and if the Association of
       Academies, which, as is well known, has not a penny of its own, were to raise the ten million marks
       necessary for the completion of (say) 120 volumes; and if scholars were to become so opulent
       that they could afford to purchase the <title TEIform="title">Thesaurus Graecus</title> for (say) 6,ooo marks-how could one
       read and use such a monstrosity?</p>
               </quote>


               <pb n="vi" TEIform="pb"/>

Diels's own solution was the compilation, not of one, but of ten Thesauri, representing the
main branches of Greek Literature, Epic, Lyric, Tragic, Comic, Philosophical, Historical,
  Mathematical and Technical, Medical, Grammatical, and Jewish-Christian, each of which,
  he thought, would equal the Latin Thesaurus in bulk!<note n="1" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">A similar suggestion had been made more than half a century earlier by F. A. Wolf in his <title TEIform="title">Vorlesungen über die Altertumswissenschaft</title> i p. 187.</note>
            </p>
            <p TEIform="p">The majority of the members of the Committee, however, were still of the opinion that
 a foundation should be laid for the Thesaurus by the preparation of full slips for the whole
 of Greek literature on the method which had been adopted for the Latin Thesaurus,
 and made a recommendation in this sense to the third assembly of the International
 Association of Academies, held at Vienna in May 1907. The Association invited the British
 Academy (represented at Vienna by Bywater) to prepare a specimen for submission to the
 meeting which was to be held in 1910; but a Committee appointed by the Academy to
 consider this proposal, consisting of Bywater, H. Jackson, S. H. Butcher, and Sir F. Kenyon,
 reported in the following sense:

<quote TEIform="quote">
                  <p TEIform="p">They (the Committee) are not convinced that the <foreign lang="la" TEIform="foreign">modus operandi</foreign> suggested for the projected
       Greek Thesaurus is the best possible. They think (a) that the Latin Thesaurus would not provide
       a proper scale and model; (b) that the mechanical slipping of Greek texts, besides being as is
       confessed a huge undertaking, would not serve as a satisfactory basis, inasmuch as it would give results
       difficult to manipulate and of questionable value. Rather, as recommended by M. Paul Meyer at the
       discussion in May 1904, they would suggest as a more promising plan that of the <title TEIform="title">New English
       Dictionary</title>.</p>
               </quote>
In the face of this report, the British Academy felt that it was useless to proceed with the
scheme, and it was tacitly dropped.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">At about the date when the project of a <title TEIform="title">Thesaurus Graecus</title> was finally abandoned,
a proposal was made by a group of Greek scholars for the preparation of a Lexicon of
the Greek language—Ancient, Medieval, and Modern-the publication of which should
commence in 1921 as a memorial of the Centenary of Greek independence. The Greek
Government took the scheme under its patronage, and in November 1908 a Commission
was appointed by royal decree, at the head of which was the veteran scholar Kontos, who
was succeeded on his death by Hatzidakis. Krumbacher, in one of his latest articles in
the <title TEIform="title">Byzantinische Zeitschrift</title>,<note n="2" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">xviii (1909), 708 ff.</note>; criticized the project, and advised the Greek scholars to
confine themselves in the first instance to the Modern tongue; and though this recommendation
was not, as it seems, formally adopted, the preliminary publications of the
Commission consist mainly in a series of studies of the modern dialects, which appear
as supplements to <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">*)aqhna=</foreign>, and it would appear that a Lexicon of Medieval and Modern
Greek is contemplated in the first instance.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">When it became clear that Mr. Sidgwick would be unable to carry out the revision
of the Lexicon, the Delegates of the Clarendon Press invited me to undertake the work
which I did in the autumn of 1911, having been elected by Trinity College to a Research
Fellowship which I continued to hold (except for a short period during the war) until my
election to the Camden Professorship of Ancient History at the close of 1919. It was hoped
at first that the preparation of a revised text might be completed in five years; but before
the work had progressed very far it became clear that a more drastic revision than was
suggested by a cursory examination would be necessary.   Moreover, such large gaps
(especially in technical subjects) remained to be filled if the new edition was to be adequate
to the needs of modern scholarship—to say nothing of the large mass of new material awaiting
incorporation-that the time allotted was evidently insufficient for more than a preliminary
revision of Liddell and Scott's text, which would afterwards have to be worked up into
a largely re-written Lexicon with the contributions of specialists and others whose help
might be enlisted.
                                      
<pb n="vii" TEIform="pb"/>

            </p>
            <p TEIform="p">Such assistance has been placed at my disposal with a generosity for which I cannot
 find words adequate to express my gratitude; nor would it be possible within the limits
 of this preface to enumerate all those who have supplied corrections of, or suggested
 improvements in, the text of the eighth edition. Mention, however, must be made of those
 who undertook special researches in aid of the revision.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">Taking the more technical subjects first, the most laborious task was that of revising
 and amplifying the vocabulary of Medicine. It is interesting to recall the fact that many
 years ago the late Dr. Greenhill, of Trinity College, projected a Lexicon of Greek Medicine,
 for which he collected a certain amount of material in the shape of references arranged on
 slips and worked up a small portion of it in a series of articles in the <title TEIform="title">Medico-Chirurgical
 Journal</title>. He proposed to the Delegates that he should collaborate with M. Daremberg
 in preparing his Lexicon, but the suggestion did not meet with their approval, and
 Dr. Greenhill proceeded no further; his collection of slips passed after his death into the
 possession of the Royal College of Surgeons. It was clearly necessary that the field
 should be resurveyed, and I was fortunate enough to secure the services of Dr. E. T.
 Withington, who took up residence in Oxford and has worked untiringly on this difficult
 subject. He has read for lexicographical purposes the whole of the extant remains of
 Greek medical literature, and there is scarcely a page in the Lexicon which does not bear
 traces of his handiwork.<note n="1" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">Dr. Withington has also found time to deal with the Alchemists and Astrologers, including the extensive collections of the <title TEIform="title">Catalogus Codicum Astrologorum</title>.</note>
            </p>
            <p TEIform="p">For the subject of Botany, again, expert assistance was indispensable. Sir William
Thiselton-Dyer, F.R.S., has for a long while been collecting material for a Glossary of
Greek plants, and the publication of Max Wellmann's edition of Dioscorides, completed
in 1914, has furnished a reliable critical text of the most important author in this branch of
literature. Sir William Dyer has been most generous in placing the results of his study
of Greek plant-names at my disposal, and his identifications are not likely to be disputed.
A number of them had already been communicated to Sir Arthur Hort for use in his
edition of Theophrastus' <title TEIform="title">Historia Plantarum</title>.<note n="2" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">Sir Arthur Hort has himself rendered aid in the difficult task of interpreting the Greek of Theophrastus.</note>
            </p>
            <p TEIform="p">The province of Greek Mathematics belongs in a special sense to Sir Thomas
Heath, F.R.S., Whose <title TEIform="title">History of Greek Mathematics</title> and editions of Euclid, Apollonius of
Perga, Aristarchus of Samos, and Diophantus mark him out as the first authority in this
subject. He has found leisure to contribute a large number of notes of the greatest value
on Greek mathematical terms. To take an obvious instance, it will be seen that the eighth
edition of Liddell and Scott recognizes the word <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">a)su/mptwtos</foreign> only in a Medical sense
illustrated by a quotation (not quite accurately translated) from Hippocrates; Sir Thomas
Heath has supplied the materials for a history of the use from which the modern <mentioned rend="italics" TEIform="mentioned">asymptote</mentioned>
is derived.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">In the domain of Natural History Professor D'Arcy Thompson's help has enabled me
to correct a number of mistakes made by previous lexicographers. His <title TEIform="title">Glossary of Greek
Birds</title> has been in constant use, and his version of the <title TEIform="title">Historia Animalium</title> in the Oxford
translations of Aristotle to a large extent supplies the want of a glossary of the Animal
Kingdom.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">In the field of Astronomy and Astrology I have to thank Mr. Edmund J. Webb for
reading the <title TEIform="title">Almagest</title> of Ptolemy and other astronomical writings, and thereby greatly
increasing the accuracy of the Lexicon in these matters. For the Astrological vocabulary
a glossary was drafted by the Rev. C. T. Harley Walker, and the ground has also
(as above mentioned) been worked over by Dr. Withington; but in this thorny subject
difficulties frequently arise, for which Professor A. E. Housman, when appealed to, never
fails to provide a solution.

<pb n="viii" TEIform="pb"/>
            </p>
            <p TEIform="p">Amongst technical writings must be classed those of the tacticians and military
engineers. The first were studied for my purposes by the late Mr. C. D. Chambers; the
latter group, whose works are often very difficult of interpretation, have been read
(together with other authors) by Mr. F. W. Hall.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">Besides these highly specialized branches of study, there were large tracts of literature
which it was needful to explore, but which a single editor could not hope to cover unaided.
In the matter of papyri, for example, he might be able to deal with the newly recovered
literary texts such as the <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">*)aqhnai/wn *politei/a</foreign>, Bacchylides, Herodas, Cercidas, and the
recently found fragments of the Early Lyric poets and Callimachus, but the great mass of
non-literary papyri, especially those concerned with the technique of law and administration
in Ptolemaic and Roman Egypt, required to be dealt with by those specially versed in
the new science of papyrology. The Ptolemaic papyri were therefore read, partly by
Mr. Edgar Lobel (who dealt with the Petrie collection) and partly by Professor Jouguet
of Lille, those of the Roman period by Professor Martin of Geneva. Mr. H. Idris Bell of
the British Museum has supplied valuable notes on recent papyrological publications and
on unedited documents in the British Museum Collection.<note n="1" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">The first part of Preisigke's <title TEIform="title">Wörterbuch der griechischen Papyrusurkunden</title> appeared after the sheets of Part I had been printed off, but has been used for Addenda.</note> For the vocabulary of the
Inscriptions little could be done by the editor except to revise the existing references
to Boeckh's <title TEIform="title">Corpus Inscriptionum Graecarum-no</title> light task, seeing that so many of the
stones have been re-examined and may be studied in improved texts-and to supplement
these corrected citations by illustrations from collections such as those of Dittenberger<note n="2" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">The appearance of a third edition of the <title TEIform="title">Sylloge Inscriptionum Graecarum</title>, completed in 1924, has necessitated the alteration of a large number of references. The pitfalls which beset the path of the lexicographer may be exemplified by the fact that on the first revision the word <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">a)po/plwsis</foreign> was illustrated by SIG<hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">2</hi>929.127, and this was altered by the concordance-table to SIG<hi rend="sup" TEIform="hi">3</hi>685.127: fortunately it was discovered in time that the word had disappeared in the later text!</note>
or Michel or the <title TEIform="title">Griechische Dialektinschriften</title>, with the aid of Herwerden's <title TEIform="title">Lexicon
Suppletorium</title>, a work unfortunately marred by constant inaccuracy of reference, which
it is charitable to ascribe to lack of the minute care required in lexicographical proofreading.
I was therefore compelled to invoke the aid of Mr. M. N. Tod, to whom I owe an
incalculable debt for his services in this field. Mr. Tod has for several years read with
an eye to the improvement of the Lexicon every epigraphical publication which has
appeared, such for example as the later volumes of the <title TEIform="title">Inscriptiones Graecae</title>, Cagnat's
<title TEIform="title">Inscriptiones Graecae ad res Romanas pertinentes, the Tituli Asiae Minoris</title>, and the special
publications of the inscriptions of Delphi, Ephesus, Magnesia, Miletus, and Priene, and
has excerpted the whole of the periodical literature in which inscriptions are to be found,
so that it is hard to believe that any new material of real importance which has accrued
since 1911 can have escaped his methodical scrutiny. I have also received help in
epigraphical matters from Professor M. Cary and Miss C. A. Hutton.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">Turning to Literature proper, it soon became clear that while the references to Plato
 and Aristotle needed careful revision and some amplification,<note n="3" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">Bonitz's <title TEIform="title">Index to Aristotle</title> and Ast's <title TEIform="title">Lexicon Platonicum</title> are no longer all-sufficing guides. Such words as <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">moruxw/teron</foreign> (which should be read in Arist. <title TEIform="title">Metaph</title>. 987a10) and <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">tera/mwn</foreign> (which there is reason to think once stood in the text of Pl. <title TEIform="title">Sph</title>. 221a, though it is not mentioned by Burnet) are addenda.</note> the terminology of the later
 schools of Philosophy had never been adequately treated by lexicographers.   Neither
 Usener's <title TEIform="title">Epicurea</title> nor von Arnim's <title TEIform="title">Stoicorum Veterum Fragmenta</title> possesses an index; and
 Mr. (now Professor) J. L. Stocks generously undertook to remedy this defect, and to supply
 me with a vocabulary of the important technical terms of the Stoic and Epicurean schools
 (including in his survey of the latter such later works as the tracts or other remains of
 Philodemus, Polystratus, Demetrius Lacon, Diogenianus, and Diogenes of Oenoanda).
 Unfortunately his work was interrupted by the Great War, and on his return from service
 Mr. Stocks found himself unable to work up the material which he had collected within the


<pb n="ix" TEIform="pb"/>

necessary limits of time. His notes on Stoic terminology were therefore transferred to
Mr. A. C. Pearson, who carried the work a stage further, but found, after his appointment
to the Regius Professorship of Greek at Cambridge, that he would not have time to
complete it. Professor E. V. Arnold of Bangor, who is retiring from his post, hopes to
find the leisure necessary for this much-needed work.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">In dealing with the vocabulary of Epicurus and his school Mr. Stocks found that for
an adequate treatment it would be necessary to obtain access to the transcripts of the
fragments of the <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">peri\ fu/sews</foreign> and other writings made by Wilhelm Crönert and used by
him in his revision of Passow's Lexicon, of which more will be said presently. Crönert
(who had spent some time in England as a prisoner of war in 1917-19) very kindly acceded
to a request which I made to him at the suggestion of von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff and
generously placed his transcripts at the disposal of Mr. Stocks, who visited him in Germany
and made full use of this valuable material.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">The peculiar vocabulary of the later Platonists has not hitherto received the attention
which it deserves in Lexica; it is worthy of note that even in the seventh edition (1883)
Liddell and Scott stated that the word <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">metemyu/xwsis</foreign> (which is absent from the Paris
Thesaurus and appears in Rost and Palm with the note ' Clem.Al. (?)') 'seems to be of no
authority', though in the eighth edition an example of its use is cited from Proclus'
Commentary on the <title TEIform="title">Republic</title> of Plato. As a matter of fact, this word can be quoted from
ten authors besides Proclus.<note n="1" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">D. S. 10. 6, Gal. 4. 763, Alex. Aphr. <title TEIform="title">de An</title>. 27. 18, Porph. <title TEIform="title">Abst</title>. 4. 16, Herm. ap. Stob. 1. 49. 69 (tit.), Sallust. 20, Hieronym. <title TEIform="title">Ep</title>. 124. 4, <title TEIform="title">Theol. Ar</title>. 40, Serv. ad Verg. <title TEIform="title">Aen</title>. 3. 68, Sch. Iamb. <title TEIform="title">Protr</title>. 14.</note> Professor Burnet, who in his edition of the <title TEIform="title">Phaedo</title> drew
attention to some of these passages, added: ‘Hippolytus, Clement and other Christian
writers say <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">metenswma/twsis</foreign> (“reincarnation”) which is accurate but cumbrous’; but the
implication that this word belongs to Patristic Greek is misleading. It is found in Plotinus
and in later Platonists such as Hierocles and Proclus. Again, such a characteristic use as
that of <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">a)/topos</foreign> in the philosophical sense of 'non-spatial' has escaped lexicographers. In
dealing with this branch of literature I have received help from various scholars, notably
Professor A. E. Taylor; and the late Mr. M. G. Davidson read the <title TEIform="title">Enneads</title> of Plotinus,
the abstruse work of Damascius <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">peri\ a)rxw=n</foreign>, and other treatises. The extant commentaries
on the works of Aristotle of course belong to this school of thought, and Mr. W. D. Ross
kindly undertook to supply notes on their vocabulary with the aid of the excellent indices
of the Berlin edition and with the collaboration of certain of the Oxford translators;<note n="2" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">Two of these, Mr. Erwin Webster and Mr. Gibson, lost their lives in the Great War.</note> the
bulk of this work, however, fell upon his own shoulders.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">Another branch of literature demanding special study was that of the magical and
 mystical writings-the <title TEIform="title">Corpus Hermeticum</title>, the magical papyri, the <title TEIform="title">Tabellae Defixionum</title>,
 and such like. This field was carefully worked over by Mr. Walter Scott, whose notes
 dealt very fully with the difficult words often found in these sources.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">For the New Testament the intensive study of theologians has done great things in
 recent times, and the results of their labours are readily accessible; for the ordinary
 purposes of revision such Lexica as those of Ebeling and Zorell are generally sufficient;
 while for the illustration of Biblical usage from Hellenistic and later Greek we have
 a most valuable aid in Moulton and Milligan's <title TEIform="title">Vocabulary of the Greek Testament</title> which
 (within its natural limits) may almost be regarded as a Lexicon of the <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">koinh/</foreign> as a whole.
 I owe a deep debt of gratitude to Professor Milligan for supplying advance proofs of the
 <title TEIform="title">Vocabulary</title>, the fifth part of which has just been published. Prof. A. H. McNeile and the
 Rev. A. Llewellyn Davies have advised me in matters relating to the LXX, Hexapla, etc.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">Turning to post-classical Greek literature in general, help was received from various
 scholars (amongst whom may be named Mr. Ronald Burn and Mr. C. E. Freeman, who
 excerpted several of the less familiar writers), but such merits as the new edition may


<pb n="x" TEIform="pb"/>

possess in virtue of largely increased illustration and more accurate interpretation of the
ancient texts will in the main be due to the self-effacing and monumental labours of
Mr. Herbert W. Greene, sometime Fellow of Magdalen. Amongst the materials placed
at my disposal when I began my editorial work in 1911 were twenty-four volumes of notes
compiled by Mr. Greene as contributions to the Lexicography of authors mainly (though
not by any means entirely) of post-Alexandrian date, including Lucian, the Anthology, all
the later Epic poets, the <title TEIform="title">Scriptores Erotici</title>, Aelian, Philostratus, and others. From that
time onwards Mr. Greene has not ceased to read and excerpt the remains of later Greek
literature, including the works of practically every non-technical writer of importance from
Polybius to Procopius. The twenty-four volumes have grown to nearly eighty, and many
of the notes which they contain are elaborate dissertations constituting an important
contribution to Classical Scholarship. Valuable aid has also been received from Professor
W. A. Goligher, who read the minor Greek historians, Mr. J. M. Edmonds, who supplied
a vocabulary of the Greek Lyric poets, Mr. J. H. A. Hart, who is compiling an <foreign lang="la" TEIform="foreign">index verborum</foreign>
to Philo, Professor A. W. Mair and Mr. M. T. Smiley, whose notes on Callimachus have
been of great use, and other scholars, such as Professors J. A. Platt, A. Souter, R. L. Dunbabin,
and W. L. Lorimer, Mr. T. W. Allen, Mr. A. H. Smith, Mr. G. Middleton, and
the late Mr. G. E. Underhill, to all of whom special thanks are due. The advice of
Mr. Edgar Lobel has been constantly sought and freely given, especially in regard to the
remains of Early Lyric poetry and the ancient lexicographers.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">The procedure of revision was briefly as follows. At the outset the Clarendon Press
supplied a paste-up of the eighth edition in columns, and the first step was to note in the
margin the essential alterations of the text and the most important additions. After this
had been done, a second paste-up in columns was made, and the marginalia of the first were
fused with newly accumulated material and recast in a form suitable for publication; but it
was found that the copy thus produced would present great difficulties to the printer, and
that a clean copy based on the use of short sections of Liddell and Scott's text treated as
a proof was required. When I became Camden Professor at the beginning of 1920 it
became necessary to provide me with assistance in my editorial work, and Mr. R. McKenzie
of Trinity College (now Fereday Fellow of St. John's College) was appointed AssistantEditor
by the Delegates of the Press. Apart from his arduous labour inputting my drafts
into final shape and in arranging and working in a large mass of accumulated material,
Mr. McKenzie has been able to render inestimable service to the Lexicon on the philological
side.   After careful consideration it was decided that etymological information
should be reduced to a minimum. A glance at Boisacq's <title TEIform="title">Dictionnaire étymologique de
la langue grecque</title> will show that the speculations of etymologists are rarely free from
conjecture; and the progress of comparative philology since the days of G. Curtius
(whose <title TEIform="title">Griechische Etymologie</title> was the main source drawn upon by Liddell and Scott) has
brought about the clearance of much rubbish but little solid construction. Some assured
results, however, have been attained, and the etymologies presented in the text have in
almost every case been approved by Mr. McKenzie.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">The space required for the incorporation of new material without an excessive increase
in the bulk of the Lexicon has been saved partly by abbreviations and compendious
methods of printing, partly by certain limitations of scope. Liddell and Scott, though they
originally intended their work to be a Lexicon of Classical Greek,<note n="1" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">This appears from letters written in 1877 by Dean Liddell to Mr. Falconer Madan (who kindly placed them at my disposal) with reference to J. E. B. Mayor's well-known articles on Greek Lexicography in the <title TEIform="title">Journal of Philology</title>.</note> admitted a number of
words from Ecclesiastical and Byzantine writers, for many of which no reference was given
except the symbols Eccl.' and 'Byz.' After due consideration it has been decided to exclude
both Patristic and Byzantine literature from the purview of the present edition. It would

<pb n="xi" TEIform="pb"/>

have manifestly been impossible to include more than a small and haphazard selection of
words and quotations from these literatures, which would therefore have had to be treated
quite differently from the remains of Classical Greek, where (it may be hoped) sufficient
illustration has been given of the vocabulary and usage of all writers of importance, accompanied
by precise and easily verifiable references. There is, moreover, in preparation
a Lexicon of Patristic Greek (including Christian poetry and inscriptions) under the editorship
of Dr. Darwell Stone, which will, it is hoped, be printed when the publication of the present
work is concluded.<note n="1" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">Christian authors are of course frequently cited as the source of classical quotations, and such treatises as those of Porphyry and Julian <title TEIform="title">Against the Christians</title> are reconstructed from Patristic writings.</note> For the Byzantine vocabulary we shall have to wait for the Modern
Greek Lexicon to which allusion has already been made, but it will hardly be denied that
some time-limit was called for, and this has been fixed roughly at A. D. 600 in order to include
the historians and poets of the reign of Justinian, though such writers as the scholiasts,
grammarians, and others who preserve the fragmentary remains of ancient scholarship must
naturally be taken into account in their own province.

            <p TEIform="p">The present volume will not challenge comparison in scale with the revision of
 Passow's <title TEIform="title">Wörterbuch der griechischen Sprache</title> by Wilhelm   Crönert, of which three parts,
 extending as far as <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">a)na/</foreign>, appeared in 1912-14. This monument of Herculean toil will, if
 and when it is completed (a consummation for which all lovers of learning will devoutly
 pray), bulk about three times as large as Liddell and Scott; in fact, this estimate may be
 exceeded if Crönert is able to carry out the plan foreshadowed in the preface to his second
 part, where he looks forward to the gradual expansion of his work as it proceeds (after the
 manner of Passow) by means of a fuller treatment of post-Classical Greek. Cronert's
 work has been criticized by Kretschmer,<note n="2" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">In <title TEIform="title">Glotta</title> vi pp. 300 f.</note> who regards it as too ambitious in scope and
 unlikely to be completed within a reasonable period of time, and would prefer a Lexicon
 on a somewhat smaller scale as a preliminary to the <title TEIform="title">Thesaurus Linguae Graecae</title> which
 must remain for a long while to come a pious aspiration. It may be hoped that the present
 work will do something to supply this need, and that it may be found to possess some
 compensating advantages denied to the larger Lexicon of Crönert, such as the provision
 of exact references for every word cited from an author and fuller and more representative
 quotations from the later literature, e.g. from such authors as Plotinus.<note n="3" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">A comparison of the art. <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">a)mfi/bios</foreign> in Crönert-Passow with that of the present work will illustrate the difference of method. Crönert, on the other hand, gives the lexicographical tradition of the ancient grammarians very fully. For this it would not have been possible to find room; nor, indeed, has it yet been thoroughly sifted and critically edited. The deaths of Wentzel, Leopold Cohn, and Egenolff, and the migration of Bethe and Reitzenstein to more succulent pastures, have brought the two great enterprises of the firm of Teubner-the <title TEIform="title">Corpus Grammaticorum Graecorum</title> and that of the ancient Lexica—to a premature end. De Stefani's edition of the <title TEIform="title">Etymologicum Gudianum</title> is, however, in course of appearing, and it is understood that Drachmann is editing the remains of the Glossary of' Cyril' (see Pauly-Wissowa, <title TEIform="title">Realencyclopädie</title> xii 175).</note>
            </p>
            <p TEIform="p">My best thanks are due to those scholars who are generously devoting their time to
 the reading of the proof-sheets and the verification of references, especially to the authors
 originally read by them for the purposes of the Lexicon. Some of these have already
 been named, such as Sir W. Thiselton-Dyer, Professors D'Arcy Thompson, A. E. Taylor,
 A. C. Pearson, and J. L. Stocks, Mr. Herbert Greene, Mr. Tod, Dr. Withington, Mr. Ross,
 and Mr. F. W. Hall. Lieut.-Col. Farquharson's scrutiny of the quotations from Plato and
 Aristotle is producing important results; and Messrs. C. and G. M. Cookson, Mr. W. W.
 How, and the Rev. W. Evans are doing valuable work in maintaining the standard of
 accuracy. The Editor's task is naturally heavy, especially in view of the fact that the
 progress of scholarship tends to make the text originally drafted for the Press out of date
 or to bring fresh material to light. Such publications as Ulrich Wilcken's <title TEIform="title">Urkunden der</title>



               <pb n="xii" TEIform="pb"/>

               <title TEIform="title">Ptolemäerzeit</title> furnish more accurate readings of Papyri and necessitate changes or deletions,<note n="1" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">For example, <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">a)ntipata/ssw</foreign> was cited by me from <title TEIform="title">PPar</title>. 40, but the reference was deleted from the proof when it was found that in <title TEIform="title">UPZ</title> 12 Wilcken read <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">w)nhla/tai o)/ntes</foreign> for <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">a)ntipata/ssontes</foreign>!</note>
and I must place on record my gratitude to Professor Wilcken for kindly undertaking to
verify and correct references to documents in the yet unpublished portions of his work,<note n="2" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">This should cause little inconvenience to the user of the Lexicon, as Part I of <title TEIform="title">UPZ</title> contains concordance-tables for the whole work.</note>
as also to Mr. J. U. Powell for permitting me to use and refer to the proofs of his
<title TEIform="title">Collectanea Alexandrina</title>, shortly about to appear. Professor J. Bidez and Mr. A. D. Knox
kindly sent me advanced proofs of the editions of the <title TEIform="title">Epistles of Julian</title> and of Herodas in
which they have collaborated. The care and accuracy shown by the Press readers have
been altogether exceptional.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">It has, I hope, been made abundantly clear that the new edition of Liddell and Scott's
 Lexicon is in reality the work of many hands, and represents a great sacrifice of leisure
 and an earnest devotion to Greek learning on the part of the present generation of
 scholars, and that not in this country alone. I would fain hope that in the world of science
 at least (which has, or should have, no frontiers) it may further in some small degree the
 restoration of the comity of nations.

            <p TEIform="p">The Delegates of the Oxford University Press, in issuing the tenth and last part of
the revised edition of Liddell and Scott's Greek Lexicon, wish to express their deep
gratitude to all who have assisted in carrying this undertaking to a conclusion. They
greatly regret that neither the Editor Sir Henry Stuart Jones, who died on 29 June 1939,
nor the Assistant Editor Mr. Roderick McKenzie, who died on 24 June 1937, survived to
see the work completed. McKenzie saw the main body of the work to its end, and himself
wrote the long article on <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">w(s</foreign>; Sir Henry was at work on the Addenda and Corrigenda up
to within a fortnight of his death and had almost put them into shape. The work done by
these two men could not be overrated. Sir Henry was the ideal Editor; his wide range
of knowledge and his exact scholarship, his persistent devotion to his task even in periods
of ill health, his tactful assiduity in consulting experts and his skill in co-ordinating their
results, gave the work at once its consistency and its elasticity. McKenzie, to whom fell
the arrangement, in their ultimate form, of most of the articles, provided a fine complement;
his great knowledge of comparative philology, his laborious accuracy, and his tireless
patience, gave his contribution inestimable value.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">In the Preface published in 1925 Stuart Jones sketched the history of the work up to
the publication of <foreign lang="greek" TEIform="foreign">a)pobai/nw</foreign>, and recorded the signal services given by many scholars to the
work in its formative stages. To that nothing need now be added. But Jones went on to
thank the scholars who were ' generously devoting their time to the reading of proof-sheets
and the verification of references'. It is important that the nature of this work should be
understood. The procedure adopted, when work was resumed after the Four Years' War,
was this: McKenzie wrote out Jones's corrections on a 'paste-up' of the previous edition.
This was the 'copy'; and fresh material was to some extent incorporated in it from time
to time. But as succeeding sections of the alphabet were revised and set up in type, proofs
were sent to the volunteer helpers, whose labours, in the event, went far beyond mere
verification; in their hands and the editors' the work was very largely recast. The method
has obvious advantages, and the peculiar excellences of the revised lexicon owe much to
its adoption. But inevitably it prolonged the process of gestation. The period of publication,
1925-40, was actually longer than the period of copy-writing, 1911-24, even although
the earlier period was interrupted by the war, and in the later period there were two
editors instead of one.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">Of those who were named in the original Preface as having embarked on the labour of
proof-reading, some are dead: notably Sir William T. Thiselton-Dyer, A. C. Pearson, and
Herbert Greene.<note n="1" anchored="yes" place="unspecified" TEIform="note">Greene's notebooks (see the 1925 Preface, p. x) are in the Bodleian.</note> Others have lived to see the work to its end. These, and not these
alone, have more than doubled the debt of gratitude which, fifteen years ago, Jones could
not 'find words adequate to express'.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">Unhappily neither editor lived to prepare a final list of acknowledgements. McKenzie
died suddenly in 1937. Jones, though he lived to see the end in sight, left no material for
the brief 'epilogue' which it had been agreed he should furnish. It would be impossible
now to produce a complete or balanced account of the labours of the proof-readers and
verifiers without undertaking inquiries which the circumstances of the time make difficult.
The list which follows does not attempt discrimination. Special mention must, however,
be made of the prolonged and arduous labours of Mr. M. N. Tod of Oriel College on the
inscriptions; of Lt.-Col. A. S. L. Farquharson of University College on Plato and Aristotle;

<pb n="xiv" TEIform="pb"/>

of Dr. E. T. Withington of Balliol College on the medical writers; of Sir D'Arcy Thompson
of St. Andrews on natural history; and of the late Sir Thomas Heath on mathematics and
astrology.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">The proofs were read also, in whole or in part, by the following: Mr. P. V. M. Benecke
 of Magdalen College; Mr. F. H. Colson of St. John's College, Cambridge; Mr. Christopher
 Cookson of Magdalen College; Prof. E. S. Forster of Sheffield University; Mr. E. T. D.
 Jenkins of University College, Aberystwyth; Mr. Edgar Lobel of the Queen's College;
 Mr. W. L. Lorimer of St. Andrews; Prof. J. F. Mountford of Liverpool University;
 Mr. Maurice Platnauer of Brasenose College; Sir David Ross, Provost of Oriel College;
 Prof. A. E. Taylor of Edinburgh; and by the late F. W. Hall, A. E. Housman, A. C. Pearson,
 J. A. Smith, and J. L. Stocks. As press reader from the beginning of the work Mr.
 T. Bruce has made a special contribution to its accuracy.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">The Addenda and Corrigenda issued with the several parts have been greatly enlarged,
 and are now consolidated in a single list. Of these, the proofs were read by Dr. H. Idris
 Bell of the British Museum, Prof. G. R. Driver of Magdalen College, and Prof. Paul Maas
 of Königsberg, as well as by some of those who have been named above.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">The Addenda owe much to the reviews and private communications of Dr. Ernest
 Harrison of Trinity College, Cambridge; of Prof. Maas; of Prof. R. Pfeiffer of Munich (it
 is noted with pleasure that both Prof. Maas and Prof. Pfeiffer are now resident in Oxford);
 of Prof. K. Latte of Hamburg; of Prof. W. Schmid of Tübingen; of Herr Pfarrer P. Katz
 of Coblenz, and of many other scholars.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">Both in the Addenda and in the main work the principle of anonymity has been applied to
 original contributions that appear first in the Lexicon, and it was the intention of the Editors
 that those who made them should be free at any later time to claim their own discoveries.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">Miss Margaret Alford, who bears an honoured name, helped Sir Henry Stuart Jones
 in the compilation of the Addenda, and since his death, with the collaboration of Professor
 Maas in the final stages, has performed the laborious duty of preparing the Addenda for
 Part 10 and of correcting proofs of the whole.
</p>
            <p TEIform="p">It is impossible now, as it was impossible in 1925, to name all who have contributed to
 the improvement of the great lexicon. The sacrifice of leisure, and the devotion to Greek
 learning, of which Jones then wrote, have been nobly sustained by a generation of scholars,
 and the monument of unselfish industry is at last complete.

               <p TEIform="p">The lists which follow are designed to make it easy for the reader to trace the quotations given in the Lexicon.
The general list of abbreviations (V) gives references, where needed, to one or other of the lists (I-IV) in which
the expansion will be found; but the abbreviated names of authors have not been inserted in List V unless their
alphabetical position in List I is different from that of the full name (e.g. A. = Aeschylus). List V also contains
the expansion of all abbreviations used without explanation in List I. The names of authors are in general
printed in roman type, the titles of their works (given in alphabetical order under the author's name) in italics,
which are also used for the titles of collections and periodical publications.
</p>
               <p TEIform="p">The list of authors (I) is not intended to furnish a bibliography of Greek Literature, but to indicate the
editions which have been followed in respect of the form of reference, i.e. pagination, numeration of books, chapters,
sections, lines, fragments, &amp;c.; where the form adopted in the Lexicon differs from that of the edition cited (e.g.
where the pagination of an earlier editor is used, but may be found in the margin of a later edition) the fact is stated.
It will be understood that the reading adopted in the edition cited is not necessarily given (or referred to) in the
Lexicon. For the convenience of readers a few editions of the fragments of individual authors have been named
in the list, even when the remains of the author have been cited from the sources of the quotations. Where
no abbreviation follows the author's name the full name is used in the Lexicon, and where no date is given it is to
be understood that evidence to determine it is lacking. No attempt has in general been made to indicate which of
the works attributed to an author are to be regarded as spurious.
</p>
               <p TEIform="p">In the description of the editions used ' OCT' is added to show that the work is one of the Oxford Classical
Texts (<title TEIform="title">Scriptorum Classicorum Bibliotheca Oxoniensis</title>); similarly 'T.' indicates the smaller Teubner Series (<title TEIform="title">Bibliotheca
Scriptorum Graecorum et Romanorum Teubneriana</title>), ' D.' the Didot editions, and 'Loeb' the Loeb Classical Library.

               <p TEIform="p">Where the works of an author have been divided into recognized chapters and sections these are usually given,
and the orators are (when possible) cited by speech and section; but references by page are given in accordance
with custom to Aristotle (Bekker), the commentators on Aristotle (Berlin edition), Plato (Stephanus), Philo (Mangey),
Plutarch's <title TEIform="title">Moralia</title> (Wyttenbach), Galen (Kühn, except for certain recently edited treatises), Athenaeus (Casaubon),
Julian (Spanheim), and Themistius (Hardouin). Page-references to other authors are in general introduced by 'p.'
and followed by the initial of the editor's name; if not, the facts are stated in List I. The symbol' <title TEIform="title">Fr</title>.' (= <title TEIform="title">Fragment</title>)
is generally used where the remains of an author consist partly of complete works and partly of quotations ; a simple
number denotes a fragment drawn from one of the collections indicated in List I. Where supplementary or recent
but uncompleted collections are quoted, the initial of the editor (e.g. ' D.' for Demiańczuk, 'J.' for Jacoby) is added
to the number of the fragment. The annotations of ancient commentators are cited either by reference to the
passage discussed or as substantive works: thus 'Ulp. ad D.' followed by reference to speech and section, but
'Did. <title TEIform="title">in D</title>.' cited by column and line of papyrus.</p>
